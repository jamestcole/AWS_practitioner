You can decouple your applications using SQS , SNS or Kinesis. These services can scale independantly from our application.

## AWS SQS

This is a simple queue service. They can be used to dcouple between application tiers. It is a fully managed , serverless service and there are is no limit on how many messages can be in the queue.
